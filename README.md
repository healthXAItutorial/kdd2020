# KDD 2020 Tutorial on Human-Centered Explainability for Healthcare


## Goal

The primary goal of this tutorial is to acknowledge the
many aspects/dimensions to explainability and review
the appropriate choices that depend on the persona of
the consumer of the explanation

## Description

In recent years, the rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
techniques along with an ever-increasing availability of healthcare data have
made many novel analyses possible. Significant successes have been observed
in a wide range of tasks such as next diagnosis prediction, AKI prediction,
adverse event predictions including mortality and unexpected hospital
re-admissions.  However, there has been limited adoption and use in clinical
practice of these methods due to their black-box nature. Significant amount
of research is currently focused on making such methods more interpretable or
to make post-hoc explanations more accessible. However, most of this work is
done at a very low level and as a result may not have direct impact at the
point-of-care.  This tutorial will provide an overview of the landscape of
different approaches that have been developed for explainability in
healthcare.  Specifically,  we will present the problem of explainability as
it pertains to various personas involved in healthcare viz. data scientists,
clinical researchers, and clinicians. We will chart out the requirements for
such personas and present an overview of the different approaches that can
address such needs. We will also walk-through several use-cases for such
approaches. In the process, we will also demonstrate how to perform such
analysis using open source tools such as the IBM AI Explainability 360 Open
Source Toolkit.
